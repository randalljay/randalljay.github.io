As recent graduate from General Assembly, with certification in Data Science, I have completed a project for a company called Uprise. This project has enabled me to develop not only specific data science industry experience, but also a valuable and transferable skill set in this fast-paced sector. I completed this project utilising machine learning, statistics, problem solving, and programming. I am looking to secure a position in a data driven organisation, where I can bring immediate and strategic value and develop my current skill set further.

### More Information

I've always been interested in data analytics and business strategy. I wanted to take my data analytics skills to the next level which is why I completed the data science immersive course at General Assembly. The skills the course equipped me with include Python, machine learning, visualization and SQL. I intend on using these skills to change industry.
